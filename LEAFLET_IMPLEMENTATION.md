## 📍 Default View

**Center:** India  
**Coordinates:** [20.5937, 78.9629]  
**Zoom Level:** 5

---

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### File Modified:
```
resources/views/admin/kml/viewer.blade.php
```

### Code Structure:
```javascript
1. Libraries loaded via CDN (unpkg.com)
2. Map initialization on DOMContentLoaded
3. initMap() creates Leaflet instance
4. loadKmlFile() handles KML loading
5. clearMap() resets the view
6. Event listeners for user interactions
```

### CDN Links Used:
```html
<!-- Leaflet CSS -->
https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.9.4/dist/leaflet.css

<!-- Leaflet JS -->
https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.9.4/dist/leaflet.js

<!-- Omnivore for KML -->
https://unpkg.com/@mapbox/leaflet-omnivore@0.3.4/leaflet-omnivore.min.js
```

---

## 💡 How It Works

### Step-by-Step Flow:

1. **Page Load**
   ```
   → DOM loads
   → Preloader hides after 1s
   → initMap() is called
   → Map displays with satellite view
   ```

2. **User Clicks KML File**
   ```
   → loadKmlFile(filename, url) called
   → Previous KML removed (if any)
   → New KML loaded via Omnivore
   → Map auto-zooms to KML bounds
   → Success message displayed
   ```

3. **KML Rendering**
   ```
   → Polygons styled with cyan color
   → Polylines get custom weight
   → Popups added if data available
   → Interactive hover/click enabled
   ```

4. **Clear Map**
   ```
   → Remove KML layer
   → Reset to default view
   → Clear UI indicators
   → Deselect active file
   ```
